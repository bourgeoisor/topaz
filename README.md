# Topaz

Topaz is the codename for a multiplayer sandbox aRPG made in C# using MonoGame.

## How to Compile

Topaz is currently being developed using Visual Studio and as such, some VS files are checked. Any modern C# IDE should do the trick, though.

Make sure you have MonoGame installed. Topaz currently use version **3.7.1** which is available [here](http://community.monogame.net/t/monogame-3-7-1-release/11173).
